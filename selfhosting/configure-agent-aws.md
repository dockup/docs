# AWS agent configuration instructions


### Configuring base domain

After installing agent, you would have configured DNS. You need to specify the
key and domain name without wildcard for agent.

For example, if you own "acme.com" and you want your deployment URLs to be
"<random_string>.dockup.acme.com", then your base domain is dockup.acme.com and
same should be configured in agent settings.

### Configuring registry

Please write to support@getdockup.com for automatic management of ECR.
